# Computers, People, and Programming

## Introduction

> Our civilization runs on software.
> In particular, a person with an "all I care about is computers and programming" attitude will be incapable of interacting with his or her non-programmer colleagues. Such a person will not only miss out the best parts of human interactions (ie., life) but also be a bad software developer.
