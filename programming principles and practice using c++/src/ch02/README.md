# Hello, World

## Review

1. The `hello, world` is the entrance to the programming world.
2. return type, function name, function parameters, function body
3. int main()
4. To tell the system that this program ends without problems.
5. To compile cpp to obj.
6. To include some pre-defined functions or variables.
7. header, it's the interface with other codes.
8. it link source object codes and library object codes to generate the executable program.
9. Source file is the file that programmers write, instead the object file is the file that compiler generate.
10. Integrated Development Environment, it generates executable program automaticly without
    us to compile and link the source file.
11. Practice is everything about Programming.
