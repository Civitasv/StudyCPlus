# Computation

## Review

1. Computation means to take some inputs and produce some output.
2. It is a relative concept, the input can come from a keyboard, from a mouse,
   from a touch screen etc, and the output of something maybe the input of something,
   for example, if we call `f(sqrt(x))`, then x is the input to function sqrt, and the
   value is the output of sqrt, and the input of function f at the same time.
3. Correctly, Simply, Efficiently.
4. It computes a result from a number of operands.
5. Statements include expression statements.
6. Left value, it can be changed. The `++`, `=`, `--`, `+=`, etc needs lvalue because these operators
   will change the value itself.
7. An expression that couldn't be changed after.
8. Literals include string literals, numetric literals, boolean literals, they can't be changed either.
9. A constant with symbol, we use the symbol to denote this constant.
10. Such as natural constant, the speed of light.
11. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` etc.
12. Such as `%`.
13. `+` for concatenate.
14. When we want to decide by a constant and the possible situations is too many.
15. It can only be used with constant, you can't use it with string.
16. for(initialize something; judge something; change something).
17. Whenever you can use for-loop, you should use for-loop rather while-loop.
18. cout << int(char_val);
19. It takes a int type for argument, its name is `foo`, it returns a char.
20. When it will be used several times.
21. `-`.
22. `size()`.
23. The index is 2.
24. Just use `for..in`.
25. It declares a vector which has an initial size of 26.
26. It adds an element to the vector.
27. `begin()` returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the vector.
    `end()` returns an iterator pointing to next to last element of the vector.
    `size()` returns the size of vector.
28. It can auto expands, C++ has so mang useful apis for this type.
29. sort(vector_val).
