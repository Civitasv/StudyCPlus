# Objects, Types, and Values

## Review

1. prompt means some hints given by us.
2. cin.
3. as follow:

    ```cpp
    cout << "Please enter the value of number:\n";
    cin >> number;
    ```

4. `\n` called newline.
5. whitespaces, such as newline, space, tab etc.
6. A whitespace or an input that is not an integer.
7. cout <<"Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";
8. A region of memory that holds a value of a given type that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it.
9. Literals represent values of various types.
10. Integer, Double, String, etc.
11. It's a named object.
12. Every char, int or double in a same machine has the same size.
13. For ints we use usually 4 bytes which are 32 bits. A string is of variable size with its length stored and made up of single characters that require each 1 byte of memory.
14. `=` is used to assignment, `==` is used to compare two objects.
15. A definition is a declaration that sets aside memory for an object.
16. Initialization is used to give a variable a initial value, assignment is used to give a variable a new value.
17. `+` is used for concatenation.
18. A name starts with a letter and contains only letters, digits, and underscores.
19. _string, string, m3, hjk, fl.
20. clear, meaningful.
21. Every object is given a type when it is defined. A program - or a part of a program - is type-safe when
    objects are used only accroding to the rules for their types.
22. Narrowing conversion.
23. A conversion is unsafe if the amount of memory reserved for the destination type is less than the memory
    reserved for the source type.
